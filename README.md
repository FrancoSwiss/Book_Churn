CHURN: How to improve customer loyalty with Tableau and Machine Learning

Summary:
"Machine Learning can help improving customer loyalty and revenues. But without first analyzing your customers, Machine Learning is
just a tool. We need to know first (1) which customer churn and (2) which customers we care about. This is where Tableau can be
extremly useful. With this information, we can create much better churn prediction models and improve revenues long-term."
